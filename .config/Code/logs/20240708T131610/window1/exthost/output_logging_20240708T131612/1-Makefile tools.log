The Makefile Tools extension process of configuring your project is about to run 'make --dry-run' in order to parse the output for useful information. This is needed to calculate accurate IntelliSense and targets information. Although in general 'make --dry-run' only lists (without executing) the operations 'make' would do in the current context, it is still possible some code to be executed, like $(shell) syntax in the makefile or recursive invocations of the $(MAKE) variable.
If you don't feel comfortable allowing this configure process and 'make --dry-run' to be invoked by the extension, you can chose a recent full, clean, verbose and up-to-date build log as an alternative, via the setting 'makefile.buildLog'.

You can see the detailed dry-run output at /home/hgoo2825/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage/68646289e2cd945fb2a70cbf5702b2bf/ms-vscode.makefile-tools/dryrun.log
Make sure that the extension is invoking the same make command as in your development prompt environment.
You may need to define or tweak a custom makefile configuration in settings via 'makefile.configurations' like described here: [link]
Also make sure your code base does not have any known issues with the dry-run switches used by this extension (makefile.dryrunSwitches).
If you are not able to fix the dry-run, open a GitHub issue in Makefile Tools repo: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-makefile-tools/issues
